# Heart Disease Project

In this project, I will analyze and visualize data of healthy patients and patients with Heart Disease from the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci.

After analyzing and visualizing the data, I will make a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict whether or not a patient has Heart Disease, given information about them.

The Jupyter Notebooks should be read in this order:

1. heart_disease_eda (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. heart_disease_model (Machine Learning Model)

This project is an assignment for Launch Code / Coder Girl's Data Science program.
